**Loan Origination System - High-Level Architecture Design**

---

### Overview

Designing a system to handle 5,000 loan applications per day with robust integrations, real-time updates, compliance, and scalability.

---

### 1. **Service Boundaries & Responsibilities**

**1.1. API Gateway**

* Handles external traffic
* Routes requests to internal services
* Authenticates and rate-limits

**1.2. Application Service**

* Accepts and validates loan applications
* Triggers downstream processes (credit checks, document processing)

**1.3. Document Processing Service**

* Extracts and classifies content from uploaded PDFs, images
* Uses OCR/AI models for image-based documents

**1.4. Credit Bureau Integration Service**

* Fetches credit scores and reports via third-party APIs
* Normalizes data from various providers

**1.5. Decision Engine Service**

* Runs rule-based and ML-based evaluations
* Determines application status (approve/reject/pending)

**1.6. Notification Service**

* Sends real-time updates to loan officers and applicants

**1.7. Compliance & Audit Service**

* Logs access and modifications
* Stores data for regulatory compliance

**1.8. User Management Service**

* Manages loan officer and applicant accounts, permissions

### 2. **Data Flow: Application to Decision**

```
User submits application + documents --> API Gateway --> Application Service
                                             |
                                             +--> Document Processing Service
                                             +--> Credit Bureau Integration
                                             +--> Decision Engine
                                                  |
                                                  +--> Updates DB & sends status via Notification Service
```

---

### 3. **Storage Decisions**

**Relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL):**

* User accounts, loan application metadata, audit logs

**Object Storage (e.g., S3, GCS):**

* PDFs, images, credit reports
* Encrypted at rest with KMS

**Search Engine (e.g., OpenSearch):**

* Fast search for loan status, logs, history

**Cache (e.g., Redis):**

* Real-time status delivery and session management

---

### 4. **Scalability Considerations**

**Application Layer:**

* Containerized (Docker) & orchestrated (Kubernetes)
* Autoscaling enabled

**Asynchronous Processing:**

* Use message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for decoupled, resilient workflows
* Event-driven processing (e.g., document scanned -> trigger evaluation)

**Database Layer:**

* Read replicas for heavy read operations
* Partitioning & sharding for high throughput

**Monitoring & Alerting:**

* Integrated observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
* Track SLA/SLO adherence

---

### 5. **Compliance & Security**

* Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
* Implement RBAC and audit logging
* Regular backups and retention policies
* Comply with regional financial regulations (e.g., GDPR, OJK, etc.)

---

**Conclusion:**
This modular, service-oriented architecture supports scalability, security, real-time processing, and regulatory compliance for a modern loan origination platform.
